Hypertension and hypertensive heart disease. Two years ago, he was diagnosed with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and received treatment with amiodarone for 18 months at a dose of 200 mg / day and subsequently 400 mg / day in the last 6 months. Five months ago he presented a picture of cough, fever and dyspnea. A chest x-ray was performed (image A) and he received antibiotic and steroid treatment with improvement. The subsequent radiological control was normal. He came to the clinic for presenting asthenia, fever and cough of 2 weeks of evolution. In the laboratory, normal blood count, C reactive protein 9.5 mg / dL (normal 0-1), ESR 39 mm (1st hour). A chest x-ray is performed (image B) and admission is decided. A bronchoscopy was performed with bronchoalveolar lavage, with the following cell count: lymphocytes 74% (ratio CD4 / CD8 = 0.9), macrophages 18%, neutrophils 4%. Cytology is reported with the presence of foamy macrophages. A video-assisted thoracoscopy biopsy is indicated. Given the clinical, radiological and analytical findings with which we already have, we can conclude:","{'0': 'The most likely pathological picture is organized pneumonia.', '1': 'An amiodarone pneumonitis seems unlikely given that the patient has taken the drug for 2 years.', '2': 'The lymphocyte ratio of bronchoalveolar lavage suggests a picture of sarcoidosis.', '3': 'The picture suggests a pneumonia of fibrotic type.'}",The most likely pathological picture is organized pneumonia.,0,"```json

360,7263,"Background: There is a lack of consensus about whether the initial imaging method for patients with suspected nephrolithiasis should be computed tomography (CT) or ultrasonography.
Methods: In this multicenter, pragmatic, comparative effectiveness trial, we randomly assigned patients 18 to 76 years of age who presented to the emergency department with suspected nephrolithiasis to undergo initial diagnostic ultrasonography performed by an emergency physician (point-of-care ultrasonography), ultrasonography performed by a radiologist (radiology ultrasonography), or abdominal non-contrast CT. Subsequent management, including additional imaging, was at the discretion of the physician. We compared the three groups with respect to the 30-day incidence of high-risk diagnoses with complications that could be related to missed or delayed diagnosis and the 6-month cumulative radiation exposure. Secondary outcomes were serious adverse events, related serious adverse events (deemed attributable to study participation), pain (assessed on an 11-point visual-analog scale, with higher scores indicating more severe pain), return emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and diagnostic accuracy.
Results: A total of 2759 patients underwent randomization: 908 to point-of-care ultrasonography, 893 to radiology ultrasonography, and 958 to non-contrast CT abdomen The incidence of high-risk diagnoses with complications in the first 30 days was low (0.4%) and did not vary according to imaging method. The mean 6-month cumulative radiation exposure was significantly lower in the ultrasonography groups than in the CT group (p < 0.001). Serious adverse events occurred in 12.4% of the patients assigned to point-of-care ultrasonography, 10.8% of those assigned to radiology ultrasonography, and 11.2% of those assigned to CT (p = 0.50). Related adverse events were infrequent (incidence, 0.4%) and similar across groups. By 7 days, the average pain score was 2.0 in each group (p = 0.84). Return emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and diagnostic accuracy did not differ significantly among the groups.
Conclusions: Initial ultrasonography was associated with lower cumulative radiation exposure than initial CT, without significant differences in high-risk diagnoses with complications, serious adverse events, pain scores, return emergency department visits, or hospitalizations.
